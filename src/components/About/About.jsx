        About Me
      </h3>
      <p className="px-6 text-lg my-1 font-medium text-night">
        I'm a Front End Web Developer with basic knowledge in graphic designing.
        I'm passionate about expanding my knowledge in the tech field and
        solving problems. Well-versed in debugging and building responsive and
        functional websites, with a strong skill set in effective communication
        and creative thinking, and a background in teamwork and collaboration.

        As for my former education, I studied Nursing at the Lebanese University
        and graduated in 2020. It took me 1 year after graduation to
        realise that I don't want nursing as a career anymore, and that's how my
        career switching journey began. I found myself so fund with coding and
        tech, and I started looking for an oportunity to learn more. I finally
        found myself applying to one of Re:Coded's Front-End bootcamps, and I
        was one of the lucky people who where accepted there. In a period of 5
        months, I jumped from someone who knows nothing about coding, to a
        really confident Front End Web Developer who's even more ready to learn
        new things and discover the world of tech more deeply.

        Outside the coding world, I love reading, photography, hiking, and
        embroidering.
